    <h2>Introduction: The Greatest Show On Earth :</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Ispent my college years working as a valet at a nice hotel in Los
        Angeles. One frequent guest was a technology executive. He was a genius,
        having designed and patented a key component in Wi-Fi routers in his
        20s. He had started and sold several companies. He was wildly
        successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also had a relationship with money I’d describe as a mix of
        insecurity and childish stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
        He carried a stack of hundred dollar bills several inches thick. He
        showed it to everyone who wanted to see it and many who didn’t. He
        bragged openly and loudly about his wealth, often while drunk and always
        apropos of nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day he handed one of my colleagues several thousand dollars of cash
        and said,
        <mark
          >“Go to the jewelry store down the street and get me a few $1,000 gold
          coins.”</mark
        >
        An hour later, gold coins in hand, the tech executive and his buddies
        gathered around by a dock overlooking the Pacific Ocean. They then
        proceeded to throw the coins into the sea, skipping them like rocks,
        cackling as they argued whose went furthest. Just for fun. Days later he
        shattered a lamp in the hotel’s restaurant. A manager told him it was a
        <mark>$500</mark> lamp and he’d have to replace it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >“You want five hundred dollars?” the executive asked incredulously,
          while pulling a brick of cash from his pocket and handing it to the
          manager. “Here’s five thousand dollars. Now get out of my face. And
          don’t ever insult me like that again.”</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        You may wonder how long this behavior could last, and the answer was
        “not long.” I learned years later that he went broke.
      </p>

        The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to
        do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And
        behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people
